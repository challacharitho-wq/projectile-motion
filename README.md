🚀 Projectile Motion Simulator

An Interactive, Educational Physics Lab

Not just an animation — a tool to understand physics through exploration.

📌 Overview

The Projectile Motion Simulator is an interactive web-based physics lab that visualizes projectile motion while teaching the underlying physics concepts in real time.

Unlike traditional simulations that only show motion, this project allows users to:

Pause motion at any instant

Inspect physical quantities at any point

Compare multiple experiments

Understand why results occur, not just what happens

This makes it suitable for education, demonstrations, and hackathon evaluation.

🎯 Key Objectives

Visualize projectile motion accurately using physics equations

Enable experimentation and comparison

Bridge the gap between formulas and intuition

Encourage learning through interaction, not memorization

✨ Features
🟢 Core Simulation

Real-time projectile motion using kinematic equations

Smooth animated trajectory with a moving projectile (ball)

Accurate scaling for distance and height

⏸ Pause & Inspect Mode

Pause the simulation at any moment

Observe the projectile frozen in time

Values remain consistent with physics equations

🖱 Hover-to-Inspect (Interactive Probe)

Hover over any point on the trajectory to instantly view:

Time (t)

Horizontal distance (x)

Vertical height (y)

Speed (|v|)

Current motion stage (Ascending / Apex / Descending)

This turns the simulator into a virtual physics lab.

🔄 Comparison Mode

Save a previous launch

Display it as a dashed trajectory

Compare different angles, velocities, or gravity values visually

Encourages scientific reasoning and hypothesis testing.

🌍 Gravity Context

Preset gravity environments:

🌍 Earth (9.81 m/s²)

🌕 Moon (1.62 m/s²)

🔴 Mars (3.71 m/s²)

Includes contextual explanations showing how gravity affects:

Time of flight

Range

Trajectory shape

📐 Live Physics Explanation Panel

Shows:

Active formulas

Substituted values

Final numerical results

Example:

Range = (v² sin 2θ) / g
= (50² × sin 90°) / 9.81
= 254.84 m


This ensures the simulation teaches physics, not just displays it.

Adjust parameters and click Launch

That’s it — no installation required.

🧪 How to Use (Quick Guide)

Set angle, velocity, height, and gravity

Click Launch

Use Pause / Resume to freeze motion

Hover over the trajectory to inspect values

Save a run and compare with new experiments

🏆 Why This Project Stands Out (Judge Perspective)

✔ Goes beyond visualization
✔ Encourages experimentation
✔ Explains formulas with substitutions
✔ Connects physics to real-world contexts
✔ Demonstrates strong conceptual understanding

“This is not a demo — it’s a learning tool.”

🚀 Future Enhancements

Energy graphs (Kinetic vs Potential)

Velocity vector visualization

Angle optimization proof (why 45° gives max range)
